# ESP-32 Wireless Gamepad (ON GOING)

"ESP32-Wireless-Gamepad is a prototype DIY gaming solution that harnesses the powerful capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller. It implements the HID (Human Interface Device) protocol for seamless integration with various devices. The project is built on FreeRTOS for efficient multitasking and enhanced real-time performance. The gamepad communicates wirelessly through Bluetooth, providing low-latency connectivity. The GitHub repository offers comprehensive documentation, schematics, and source code for developers and hobbyists to explore and contribute.
